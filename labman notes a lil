A. DETRITAL (SILICICLASTIC) SEDIMENT AND SEDIMENTARY ROCK IS MOSTLY ONE OR MORE OF THESE:

Rock fragments:
may be angular or 
rounded; can include 
detrital chert grains (see 
“chert” below)	

Quartz grains:
angular grains freshly 
broken from their source 
and pebbles rounded 
during transportation

Feldspar grains:
large angular grains 
freshly broken from their 
source and small suban-
gular grains	

Clay:
commonly forms from 
chemical decay of 
feldspars and micas


B. BIOCHEMICAL SEDIMENT AND SEDIMENTARY ROCK IS MOSTLY EITHER OR BOTH OF THESE:
Plant fragments:
are brown in peat and 
black in coal

Shell bioclasts:
broken and whole animal 
shells

C. CHEMICAL SEDIMENT AND SEDIMENTARY ROCK IS MOSTLY MADE OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE:

Gypsum:
white or gray, easily 
scratched with your 
fingernail	

Calcite spar (crystals):
reacts with dilute HCl, 
breaks into rhombohedral 
shapes

Dolomite:
usually cryptocrystalline; 
reacts with dilute HCl only 
if it is powdered	

Halite:
gray to red cubic crystals 
(often intergrown as rock




Ooids:
tiny (< 2 mm) spheres of 
calcite or aragonite that 
resemble miniature pearls; 
reacts to dilute HCl	


Limonite:
opaque brown to yellow 
rusty-looking crusts, layers; 
cements sediment, making 
it look yellow to brown


Hematite:
opaque brick red to silver 
gray layers; cements 
sediment, making it look 
red	

Chert:
a gray, red, brown or black 
cryptocrtstalline variety of 
quartz (may contain fossils, 
including silica microfossils
